I am a maker of things. A software engineer, an automotive enthusiast and overall geek. I have some ongoing IoT projects, i work on them on my spare time and might write about some of them here. Check my twitter and github accounts for latest updates.

Originally from Tunisia I am currently living in Munich, Germany. I moved there to study informatics (computer science) and electrical engineering at TUM and then God decided that i keep there.
