## Engineering satisfaction leads to high quality submission

Made in Germany stands for quality, trust and innovation. These engineering standards won't be able to achieve without good engineering management and well-adapted evolution process.

What I'm wanting to highlight is how tech- and IT-firms in the 21st century manage the notion of agility in development processes.

A satisfied engineer is the key to success, what we miss nowadays.

## Engineering mistakes that *helped* humanity

Humans are not perfect, as we grow, we perceive an oversight over mistakes made by a generation back or maybe mistakes made decades ago.

Humans evolution pushes to Innovation, what claims Productivity which in his role postulates Creativity.

When dealing with Software Design, notions like UI/UX Design, User Adaptability to the system, Usability issues, & more decide on the success of a being-developed software in any form either on PC's, *which I personally hate*, on macs, or on mobile devices such as smartphones, Phablets & Tablets.

About these *issues* would I blog and maybe, when possible, suggest ways or facts that would bet a solution to a known problem.

Branches that interest me like Automotive Engineering, mobile device world, Home Accessories, Buildings.
