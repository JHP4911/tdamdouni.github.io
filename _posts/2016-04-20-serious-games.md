Although it is an old project I worked on, due to contractual restrictions I couldn't post this before. 
But now since the developed app in question is already 4 years on the App Store Market, I would publish this post, to provide web readers with informative stuff, which although related to Serious Games and Education, maybe of great interest in general when dealing with User  Experience Design UX, Usability issues and Software Adaptation to user satisfaction.
