## Markdown: back to .txt era

Nowadays, dealing with many unreadable [LOC](http://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Source_lines_of_code) becomes an inconvenient even for publisher to keep creative and productive, and to provide the web over and over with new informative content.

So the trend is to concentrate more on content, the publishing process should be more easy and automated. This led to the birth of the notion of editorial workflow which in other words means: a blogger writes in _for him a readable syntax_ most common Markdown Language [Syntax](http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/syntax), the blog engine generates from these text files static HTML files that can be easily hosted on servers without the need of having expensive databases.

It's easy to learn, low cost to process and open-sourced.


## About.me Notions

So the trending in the 21^st century is no more to have a Personal Home Page, which maybe got never updated after its first release, but to have an about.me *WebID-Digital-Card* of you or a brandme.io or a vizualize.me.

Afterwards, if  you wanna provide more content of you, web users should better blog, in a way I wanna describe further.

All of us have already Twitter, Facebook and Google accounts, where we interact socially, but the privacy of our data is still a great inconvenience to these social services.

If you wanna own you data, what you publish and feel free to delete, change or even patent your published ideas you could if you host these data yourself.

Dropbox is one of the most used emerging Cloud Services, who already uses Version Controlling for data hosted on their server and provide for free, ways to host even your blog.

## Self hosted blogs

Here is a review of *all* new merging CMS Blogs which man can host them self on Dropbox.
The editorial process on these blogs is even easier through new trend of using [Markdown](http://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown) for writing and publishing static blogs.
Static [Blogs](http://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blog) present a new way of easy free blogging where the data you publish you own really!

I self first discovered [Github Pages](https://pages.github.com/) where [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/docs/github-pages/) rules to generate static HTML files from Markdown files.

Then discovered many others, depending on the programming language they use to build their [CMS](http://de.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Content-Management-System) Framework.

Further I would introduce some of these Hosting Services and provide additional links to reviews made from other bloggers, that made me appreciate these free services.
